						I had the pleasure of working with Ahamed Aaqil as an
						intern at Win Authority. Despite not having previous
						industry experience, Ahamed Aaqil demonstrated an
						impressive grasp of technical concepts and consistently
						delivered high-quality work. His enthusiasm for learning
						and dedication to his tasks were evident throughout his
						time with us. Aaqil's strong technical skills, coupled
						with his positive attitude and eagerness to contribute,
						make him a valuable asset to any team. I highly
						recommend Ahamed for any future endeavors in software
						engineering
